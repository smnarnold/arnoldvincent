Our goal was to get the passerby to be intrigued by the space and walk around it. With that in mind, words related to education were pained on the sculpture; they would give a trompe-l’oeil feeling since they are painted on two sides of the column, the word seeming warped from all angles except one.&nbsp;</p>'
