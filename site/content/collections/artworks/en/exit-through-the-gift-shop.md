    textblock_text: '<p>The movie of the well known graffiti artist <a href="http://www.banksy.co.uk/" target="_blank">Banksy</a> succeeds in ridiculing the Art World. The poster concept is to demonstrate a man who’s using a painting palette like a mask in order to disguise himself as an artist. In addition, the paint stains on it replace the right eye and create a clown’s red nose, which shows the incredulity of the character</p>'
