    textblock_text: '<p>Short film about a couple in love, with circumstances making them believe the opposite. The kisses are a significant leitmotiv throughout the movie; because they are incapable of kissing each other, they doubt each otherâ€™s love. Therefore, the pink kisses on the poster support the metaphor used by the director.</p>'
