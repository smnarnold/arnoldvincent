    textblock_text: '<p>A wall during the Symposium de Murales de Sherbrooke. The concept illustrates the human thinking and creativity used to overcome obstacles/difficulties to finally reach the goal desired. In other words; the character is thinking, ideas are coming out of his head, he crossed tests such as wall formed of infinite bars, then a huge cliff, a maze. When arrived at his goal, he pressed a flag.</p>'
