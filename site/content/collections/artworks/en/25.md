    textblock_text: '<p>For their 25th anniversary celebration, ABP group contacted me in order to create a graffiti atmosphere during the event which was being held at la Tohu. The number 25 references the 25 years of ABP and a font was conceived in order to reflect both the elegance of ABP products and the graffiti style. During the night, partners, clients and friends had the chance to live the graffiti experience and tag the canvas during a live-painting session with specific graffiti material. All the signatures gathered there were meant to serve as a thank-you note, because those people are the reason why ABP has been existing for 25 years. The canvas painted live was getting more and more interesting as the people participated, thus becoming more and more colorful.</p>'
