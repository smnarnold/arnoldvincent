    textblock_text: '<p>The juxtaposition between the roundabout and the multifunctional trail in Sherbrooke inspired us to conceptualize a mural about various transportation and sustainable development through a rush to progress! In the proposal, the car&nbsp;is down and it demonstrates that the fossil fuels are outdated; The other characters move ecologically with several means of locomotion: terrestrial, aerial and aquatic. These means of transport promote healthy habits and transportation of the future, including the electric train. The paper boat defies probability and demonstrates that with imagination it is possible to design new means of transport.</p>'
