    split_text: '<p>We Pick Now is a farm workers placement agency in Okanagan <em>(British-Columbia)</em>. The branding needed to be close to the target audience; the fruit pickers From West Canada. The logo was done by hand with added textures to reflect the hand-made road signs found on the farmersâ€™ lands. The direction arrow commonly seen on those advertisements is the backbone behind the branding because of the arrow dynamism which urges us to action.</p>'
