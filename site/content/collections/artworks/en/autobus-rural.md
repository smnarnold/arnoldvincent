    textblock_text: '<p>The theme of this mural was urban agriculture. By eating locally, we have more control over the quality of our food. This practice is good for local economy as well as the environment. We represented this visually by having different foods using public transportation: plants, vegetables and animals are thus taking the bus, meaning both nature and city elements coexist in an eco-friendly environment.</p>'
