Also, using the cover flap makes it easy to match the old illustrations with the new ones. This playful and childish approach is present on many levels, notably with a simple and straightforward graphic code and bold typography. Aside from that, this project is a reflexion on the human behavior of stereotyping people in order to categorize and classify them.</p>'
