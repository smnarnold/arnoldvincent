    split_text: '<p>This product is a hypothetical brand producing bottles of water. The name «Ô» in french is pronounced the same way as <em>«eau»</em> which signifies water. In addition, «Ô» is also a way to speak to a divinity. The logo is changing depending on the source of the water: the Saint Lawrence River, the Richelieu River, the Ottawa River and the lac Saint-Jean. The slogan could be translated in English as <em>‘‘From the source to your bottle’</em>’.</p>'
