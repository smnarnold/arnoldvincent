    textblock_text: '<p>The branding for a horticulturist/landscape arranger Ronald Leduc needed to be changed without changing the reputation because Ronaldâ€™s son was to succeed him before long. In order to do this, authenticity was key. Thus, the logo reminds a monogram used by artists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Toulouse-Lautrec" target="_blank">Henri Toulouse Lautrec</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien" target="_blank">Tolkien</a> etc. Furthermore, the logo is a stamp as if all the communication in the business was certified Leduc. The grid sheet look was used to simulate the conceptual step in work of an architect, but in an organic way.</p>'
